# React + Vite

# To start the project
To spin up the folder, in the root directory, type; NPM run dev. This should start up the project.
# Difficult part
The time wasn't enough for me, as i couldn't complete it. Had about two features i couldn't implement under the time given to me. So i kinda rushed through. Didn't even notice there was a style.md file until now.
# Easiest part
lol! None was easy, it's development. Developing things aint easy. It's kinda like playing a Dark souls game
# Parting note
Thanks for the challenge. loved every bit of it.
